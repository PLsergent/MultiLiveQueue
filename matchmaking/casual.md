# Casual

{% code title="command to join a casual queue" %}
```
/queue casual
```
{% endcode %}

## Principles

The **casual queue** will match you with any players that joined the queue **without** taking the ranks into account. As a result, the result of the match will not be reflected on your ranking points.

## Queue

The bot will match **the first 4 players** that will join the queue. They will then be removed from the queue.

## Teams

When a match is found, the bot will make two random teams and create the channels accordingly.
