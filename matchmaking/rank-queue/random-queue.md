# Random queue

{% code title="command to join a random ranked queue" %}
```
/queue ranked random_queue
```
{% endcode %}

## Principles

The **random ranked queue** will match you with any players that joined the queue **within your rank**. As a result, the result of the match will be reflected on your ranking points.

## Queue

The bot will match **the first 4 players** that will join the queue within your rank. They will then be removed from the queue.

## Teams

When a match is found, the bot will make two random teams and create the channels accordingly.
